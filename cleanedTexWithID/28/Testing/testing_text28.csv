production. the later chapters supply the meanings of those terms. see in particular section d, in relation to films and television programmes; section f, in relation to video games. whether a company is the qualifying company for a qualifying production is to be assessed separately in relation to each accounting period of the company. the assessment is to be made by reference to the state of affairs at the end of that period. so far as future events are relevant to the assessment, it is to be made by reference to the reasonable expectations of the company at that time. subsections and are

production as separate trade the qualifying company for a qualifying production may elect in its company tax return for an accounting period for the production to be taxed as a separate trade. the effect of such an election is that the activities of the company in relation to the production are to be treated for corporation tax purposes as a trade separate from any other activities of the company . in this part that trade is called the separate production trade ; the accounting period to which the return containing the election relates is called the opt in period . ba duration of separate trade when the qualifying company is treated as beginning to carry on the separate production trade is determined by section dw, in the case of a film or television programme; section fo, in the case of a video game. if the result is that the separate production trade is treated as having been carried on in an accounting period before the opt in period, any relevant company tax return must be amended so as to give effect to that treatment in that earlier accounting period. once a company has made an election under section b, the activities of the company in relation to the production are to continue to be treated as a separate trade in accordance with this chapter even if the production ceases to be a qualifying production, or the company ceases to be the qualifying company for it. that is the case even if the production ceases to be regarded as a qualifying production in the opt in period as a result of events after the end of that period. finance bill schedule

company to date, and as a credit, the proportion of the qualifying company s estimated total income from the qualifying production that is treated as earned at the end of that period. for subsequent periods of account, the following are to be brought into account as a debit, the difference between the amount of the costs of the qualifying production incurred by the qualifying company to date, and the corresponding amount for the previous period, and as a credit, the difference between the proportion of the qualifying company s estimated total income from the qualifying production that is treated as earned at the end of that period, and the corresponding amount for the previous period. the proportion of the qualifying company s estimated total income that is treated as earned at the end of a period of account is given by c t i where c is the total of the costs of the qualifying production incurred by the qualifying company to date, t is the estimated total cost to the qualifying company of the qualifying production, and i is the qualifying company s estimated total income from the qualifying production. what counts as costs of, and income from, the qualifying production is determined by finance bill schedule films, television programmes and video games part new regime for films, television programmes and video games section dx, in the case of a film or television programme; section fp, in the case of a video game. but nothing in this part, except section be, allows an amount to count as costs of the qualifying production if it would not generally be allowed as a deduction in calculating the profits of a trade for corporation tax purposes. estimates for the purposes of this section must be made as at the balance sheet date for each period of account, and on a just and reasonable basis taking into consideration all relevant circumstances. subsection applies if a period of account of the separate production trade does not coincide with an accounting period of the qualifying company. the expenditure and receipts brought into account for the period under this section, and the resulting profit or loss, are to be apportioned to accounting periods of the company for the purposes of this part by reference to the number of days in the periods concerned. bc when costs are to be taken as incurred for the purposes of section bb, costs are incurred when they are represented in the state of completion of the work in progress. accordingly payments in advance for work to be done are to be ignored until the work has been carried out, and deferred payments are to be recognised to the extent that the work is represented in the state of completion. but an amount that has not been paid is not an incurred cost until there is an unconditional obligation to pay it. if an obligation is linked to income being earned from the qualifying production, no amount is to be brought into account in respect of the costs of the obligation unless an appropriate amount of income is or has been brought into account. bd preliminary expenditure this section applies if, before the qualifying company began to carry on the separate production trade, it incurred expenditure on the development of the qualifying production. finance bill schedule films, television programmes and video games part new regime for films, television programmes and video games the expenditure may be treated as expenditure of the separate production trade incurred immediately after the company began to carry on the trade. if expenditure so treated has previously been taken into account for other tax purposes, any relevant company tax return must be amended accordingly. be treatment of certain capital amounts as revenue this section applies for corporation tax purposes in relation to the separate production trade. expenditure that counts as costs of the qualifying production, and would be regarded as of a capital nature by reason only of being incurred on the creation of an asset in the form of the qualifying production, is to be treated as expenditure of a revenue nature. . receipts that count as income from the qualifying production, and would be regarded as of a capital nature, are to be treated as receipts of a revenue nature. losses in the separate trade bf carrying forward of production losses this section applies if a company makes a loss in the separate production trade in a pre completion period . the loss is not available for loss relief, except as provided in subsections and . the loss is not prevented from being carried forward under section b of cta to be deducted from profits of the separate production trade in a subsequent period. if the loss is so carried forward and deducted, the deduction is to be ignored for the purposes of section zb of cta . to the extent that the loss could be carried forward under section b of cta to the completion period or a subsequent finance bill schedule films, television programmes and video games part new regime for films, television programmes and video games accounting period, it may instead be treated for the purposes of section and part of cta as a loss made in that period. subsection does not apply to the extent that the loss is carried forward by virtue of section bg. in this section, loss relief includes any means by which a loss might be used to reduce the amount in respect of which the company, or any other person, is chargeable to tax. bg transfer of terminal loss to other qualifying production this section applies if a company ceases to carry on the separate production trade in respect of a production, the principal company could, but for the cessation of that trade, carry an amount forward under section a or b of cta to an accounting period after that in which the cessation occurs, when the trade ceases, either the principal company or another company in the same group carries on another separate production trade under this chapter , and the ceased trade and the other trade both relate to productions that are or were qualifying productions by virtue of the same chapter of this part. if the other trade is carried on by the principal company, the company may, by making a claim, treat the terminal loss as a loss made in the other trade that is carried forward under section b of cta . if the other trade is carried on by another company the principal company may surrender the terminal loss to the other company, and the other company may, by making a claim, elect for the surrendered amount to be treated as a loss made in the other trade that is carried forward under section b of cta . the carrying forward of a loss by virtue of subsection or is to the first accounting period beginning after the cessation of the ceased trade. if the

subsequent periods the production is no longer a qualifying production, or the company is no longer the qualifying company for it, the company is not entitled to an expenditure credit for the period. but that does not affect the entitlement of the company for any subsequent period in which the production is once again a qualifying production or the company is once again the qualifying company for it. if a production ceases to be regarded as a qualifying production in an accounting period as a result of events after the end of that period the qualifying company is no longer entitled to an

determine the combined covered tax balance for the standard members of the group in that territory . step if that balance is nil the effective tax rate is . otherwise, proceed to step . step divide the combined covered tax balance by the result of step . step except where step or applies, the effective tax rate of the standard members of that group is x where x is the result of step multiplied by . the combined covered tax balance for standard members of a multinational group in a territory is where those members only have positive covered tax balances , the sum of those balances, where those members only have negative covered tax balances , the sum of those balances expressed as a negative number, or where those members have a mixture of positive covered tax balances and negative covered tax balances, the amount bill part multinational top up tax chapter effective tax rate of members of a multinational group in a territory or negative given by subtracting the sum of those negative covered tax balances from the sum of those positive covered tax balances. section contains provision about the determination of covered tax balances of members of multinational groups. for the purposes of this part a member of a multinational group is a standard member if it is not an investment entity, or a minority owned member, and a stateless member of a multinational group is to be treated as being the sole member of the group located in a nominal territory. chapter calculation of adjusted profits of members of a multinational group adjusted profits of a member of a

calculated in an alternative manner. sections to set out adjustments in relation to transparent and hybrid entities and entities subject to a qualifying dividend regime . other provisions of this part may require further adjustments of underlying profits, including provision in chapter , and schedule . underlying profits as determined for statements of ultimate parent the normal rule is that the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group, other than a member that is a permanent establishment, are the member s profits as they would be determined for that member in preparing consolidated financial statements for the ultimate parent. finance bill part multinational top up tax chapter calculation of adjusted profits of members of a multinational group but those profits may instead be determined on the basis of an alternative accounting standard, and information in the separate financial accounts of the member, if all of the conditions in subsection are met. those conditions are that it is not reasonably practicable to determine those profits on the basis of the accounting standard used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent, the alternative accounting standard is an acceptable accounting standard or an authorised accounting standard, the alternative accounting standard is that used for the financial accounts of the member, and the information in those accounts is reliable. where an alternative accounting standard is used and an amount relevant to the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group is recorded in a currency other than the currency used for the consolidated financial statements of the ultimate parent, that amount is to be converted to that currency for the purposes of this part. subsection applies where the application of a particular policy of the alternative accounting standard in the determination of the profits of the member results in a significant accounting standard difference that would not arise if the accounting standard of the ultimate parent had been applied. the underlying profits are to be adjusted to eliminate that difference . information in the financial accounts of the member is reliable if an auditor applying the generally accepted auditing standards of a relevant territory would reasonably conclude the member has in place such processes relating to their preparation as are likely to make the information in the financial accounts a fair and accurate description of the income, expenses, assets and liabilities of that member. for the purposes of subsection , the following are relevant territories the territory in which the member is located; the territory in which the ultimate parent is located; if the member is a flow through

of a member of a multinational group that is a permanent establishment are the member s profits if the member has separate financial accounts, as reflected in those accounts, and if not, as reflected in the underlying profits accounts of the main entity, attributed between the permanent establishment and the main entity in accordance with section . if the member is a permanent establishment falling within paragraph of section the member s underlying profits are determined only by reference to its relevant income and relevant expenses. for the purposes of subsection the relevant income of the member is the income of the member that is exempted from tax in the territory where the main entity is located that is attributable to operations carried out outside the territory the main entity is located in, and the relevant expenses of the member are such of its expenses as are attributable to those operations and are not deducted for tax purposes in the territory of the main entity. profits of a permanent establishment are not to be taken into account in determining the adjusted profits of the main entity, and vice versa. but subsection does not apply to profits of a permanent establishment that are excluded from its profits as a result of an adjustment under section , and is subject to section . underlying profits accounts in this part, reference to the underlying profits accounts of a member of a multinational group is to the statements or accounts that are the basis of the determination of the member s underlying profits for the purposes of this part. no amounts

consolidation adjustments to eliminate intragroup transactions the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group are to be adjusted so that they include income, expenses, gains and losses arising from transactions between that member and other members of that group. subsection is subject to section , and section . profits adjusted to be profits before certain purchase accounting adjustments the underlying profits of a member of a multinational group for an accounting period are to be adjusted so that they do not reflect relevant share acquisition adjustments. relevant share acquisition adjustment means a purchase accounting adjustment to the consolidated financial statements of an ultimate parent of a multinational group arising as a result of an entity becoming a member of the group as a result of the acquisition of shares in the entity by an existing member of the group. this section does not apply to a relevant share acquisition adjustment resulting from an acquisition of shares before december if it is not reasonably practicable to identify the adjustment made. finance bill part multinational top up tax chapter calculation of adjusted profits of members

election under section ; a dividend or other distribution made by a member of a multinational group if its recipient is a member of the same group, and payments in respect of the distribution are treated as an expense of the member that made it for the purposes of determining the member s underlying profits, or any other dividend or other distribution to the extent it reflects debt rather than a qualifying interest. for the purposes of subsection a qualifying interest in an entity held by a member of a multinational group is a portfolio holding if, on the vesting date of the distribution, the members of that group do not, between them, have qualifying interests that entitle them to or more of the entity s profits, capital, reserves, and voting rights. a portfolio holding held by a member of a multinational group is a short term portfolio holding if it was held for less than year before the vesting date of the distribution. the vesting date of a distribution is the earlier of

first arose, and the time when the recapture amount has reduced to nil. section sets out how recapture amounts reduce. if the recapture amount in respect of an accounting period has not reduced to nil by the end of the fourth accounting period after that period the following are to be recalculated for the period in which the recapture amount arose, with the amount of the recapture amount remaining subtracted from the combined covered tax balance the effective tax rate for those members, and the top up amounts that those members would have following that recalculation. reduction of recapture

period, and after making reductions in accordance with subsections to an amount of that collective loss remains available, and the amount of that qualifying carried forward loss is the amount of the collective loss that remained available. any amount of qualifying taxes accrued by a member of the group that is used to reduce a recapture amount is excluded from that member s covered tax balance. recalculation where member leaves the group this section applies where in an accounting period , a standard member of a multinational group in a territory leaves the group, transfers all, or

purposes of this part, standard members of a multinational group in a territory have a qdt credit for a territory for an accounting period if qualifying domestic top up tax is accrued by one or more of those members in that territory in that period. where the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section for the period, and the result of step in subsection is equal to or greater than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top up tax accrued by those members in that period, the total top up amount is to be reduced by the sum of those amounts. where the standard members do not have a collective additional amount under section for the period, and the result of step in subsection is less than the sum of amounts of qualifying domestic top up tax accrued by those members in the period, the total top up amount is to be reduced to nil. where the standard members have a collective additional amount under section for the period, and the sum of the result of step

the proportion given by dividing the member s ancillary international shipping profits for the period, by the amount given by subtracting the member s ancillary international shipping costs from the member s ancillary international shipping revenue for the period. eligible payroll costs and eligible tangible asset amount permanent establishments and flow through entities in calculating the eligible payroll costs and eligible tangible asset amount of a permanent establishment, the only amounts to be taken into account are amounts that would be taken into account in determining the adjusted profits of the establishment. but if, following the application of subsection , the value of an eligible tangible asset used in the business of the establishment has not been taken into account in calculating the eligible tangible asset amount of the establishment, the value of that asset is to be taken into account as well. in calculating the eligible payroll costs and eligible tangible asset amount of a flow through entity, the only amounts to be taken into account are amounts that would be taken into account in determining the adjusted profits of the entity. election to treat total top up amount as nil the filing member of a multinational group may elect that the total top up amount for an accounting period for a territory is to be treated as nil. an election under

qualifying accounting periods. the current period is a qualifying accounting period. each of the previous two accounting periods is a qualifying period unless none of the standard members of the group in the territory had revenue in that period, and none of the standard members of the group in the territory made a loss in that period. where a qualifying period is longer or shorter than a year, the adjusted profits and revenue of the members are to be treated for the purposes of this section as the amounts given by multiplying the profits and revenue by the amount given by dividing by the number of days in the period. an election under this section may not be made in respect of the nominal territory of a stateless member of a multinational group. paragraph of schedule applies to an election under this section. chapter allocating top up amounts to responsible members top up amounts multiplied by inclusion ratio the amount of a top up amount of a member of a multinational group that is attributed to a responsible member is found by multiplying the top up amount by the responsible member s inclusion ratio for the member whose top up amount it is. where the responsible member s

by the amount determined under step . the amount of profits of the relevant member attributable to ownership interests held by entities other than the responsible member is the amount that would, in hypothetical consolidated financial statements prepared by the responsible member , have been treated in those statements as attributable to such entities under the principles of the authorised accounting standard used, or treated as used , in the ultimate parent s consolidated financial statements. for the purposes of determining what that amount would be in those hypothetical consolidated financial statements of the responsible member, use the following assumptions the relevant member s profits were its adjusted profits as determined in accordance with chapter ; the responsible member had a controlling interest in the relevant member such that all of its income and expenses were consolidated on a line by line basis with those of the responsible member; all of the profits of the relevant member were attributable to transactions with persons who are not members of the multinational group; all ownership interests that are not directly or indirectly held by the responsible member were held by persons other than members of the multinational group. where the relevant member is a flow through entity, none of the adjusted profits of the relevant member are to be regarded as attributable to ownership interests held by entities that are not members of the group . finance bill part multinational top up tax chapter allocating top up amounts to responsible members chapter

to the relevant adjustment is to be treated, for the purpose of determining the member s adjusted profits in the adjustment period and subsequent accounting periods, as its fair value immediately after occurrence of the event that caused, or enabled, the adjustment to be made. an adjustment amount is to be included in the adjusted profits of the member for the adjustment period, or split into equal amounts to be included in the adjusted profits of the member in that period and the subsequent accounting periods. but where the adjustment amount is split between those accounting periods and

for a previous accounting period is to be included in the adjusted profits of the member for the final accounting period in which it was a member of the group. the adjustment amount of a member of a multinational group in respect of an asset or liability subject to a relevant adjustment is the amount given by subtracting the carrying value of the asset or liability immediately before the event that caused, or enabled, the adjustment to be made from the fair value of the asset immediately after occurrence of that event, and if that event resulted in a non qualifying gain or loss for the member in the case of a non qualifying gain, reducing the result of paragraph by the amount of that gain, or in the case of a non qualifying loss, increasing the result of paragraph by the amount of that loss. paragraph of schedule applies to an election under this section. post filing adjustments of covered taxes this section applies where, in an accounting period , the liability of a member of

subsection applies where that liability has decreased, unless the decrease is to be treated as insignificant. where this subsection applies, the covered tax balance of the member for the current period is to be adjusted so as to reflect the amount of that increase or decrease if not already reflected in that balance. where this subsection applies the following are to be recalculated for the prior period to take account of the decrease the effective tax rate for the member and the other members of that group located in the same territory, the top up amounts that those members would have, and if the liability to covered taxes has decreased because of a reduction of the member s profits, its adjusted profits but only to the extent necessary to prevent the effective tax rate from decreasing, the adjusted profits of those members in subsequent accounting periods are to be adjusted in consequence of the decrease, and the matters referred to in paragraph recalculated accordingly, and if the amount of the decrease is reflected in the covered tax balance of the member for the current period, that balance is to be adjusted to exclude it. section applies to a recalculation under subsection . where subsection applies in relation to a decrease in liability to covered taxes that arises as a result of the member offsetting a loss in a later accounting period against profits in the prior period, the member is treated for the purposes of this part as having a deferred tax asset that arises in the later period that is equal to the amount offset multiplied by the lesser of , and the tax rate that applied to the profits the amount was offset against, and as having used that asset in the prior accounting period. for the purposes of this section, a decrease of liability is to be treated as insignificant if the aggregate decrease in liability for covered taxes for the prior period is less than million euros, and the filing member has made an election for decreases in the prior period to be treated as insignificant. paragraph of schedule applies to an election under this subsection. finance bill part multinational top up tax chapter further adjustments effect of rate changes to deferred tax expense where the rate of tax for a member of a multinational group changes in an accounting period, the change in rate is to some extent relevant, and the effect of the rate change would reduce the member s covered tax balance in a previous accounting period if the deferred tax expense in that period were recalculated to take account of the change in the rate, section applies to so much of that reduction as reflects the extent of the change in rate that is relevant as it applies to a decrease in liability to covered taxes. where the rate of tax for a member of a multinational group changed in a previous accounting period, the change in rate is to some extent relevant, the member s deferred tax expense for the current accounting period reflects the reversal of deferred tax assets or liabilities that were recognised in an accounting period prior to the rate change at a different rate, and the effect of the rate change would increase the member s covered tax balance in a previous accounting period if the deferred tax expense in that period were recalculated to take account of the change in the rate, section applies to so much of that increase as reflects the extent of the change in rate that is relevant as it applies to a increase in liability to covered taxes. for the purposes of subsections and , a change of a rate of tax is relevant to the extent that in the case of a rate that is increasing, it reflects an increase from below to the lesser of the rate it is changed to, and , and in the case of a rate that is decreasing, it reflects a decrease from the lesser of the previous rate, and . adjustment where covered taxes not paid where an amount of current tax expense included in the covered tax balance of a member of a multinational group for

company has the meaning it has in the corporation tax acts ; generating undertaking means a company, other than a company that is a member of a group, that operates a relevant generating station, or a group of companies that includes at least one member who operates a relevant generating station; a generating station is relevant finance bill part electricity generator levy if it generates electricity at a relevant place and is not a generating station that mainly generates electricity as a result of the burning of oil, coal or natural gas, or as a result of the use of plant driven by water, where the power is mainly a result of the hydrostatic head of the water having been increased by pumping, and to the extent that it is not subject to a contract for difference within the meaning of chapter of part of the energy act , an investment contract within the meaning of schedule to that act , a revenue collection contract within the meaning of part of the nuclear energy act , or feed in tariff export payments; relevant place means a place in the united kingdom, the territorial sea of the united kingdom, or a renewable energy zone within the meaning of part of the energy act of that act ; a generating station is subject to a contract for difference or an investment contract to the extent that its output may give rise to payments under such an instrument, and to feed in tariff export payments to the extent its output gives rise to such payments, and to a revenue collection contract if the station is the subject of such a contract. references in this part to a qualifying period in relation to a generating undertaking means the period, if any, between the beginning of january and the commencement of the first accounting period of the undertaking that commences on or after january , the first accounting period of the undertaking commencing on or after january , every subsequent accounting period of the undertaking that ends on or before march , and the period, if any, between the end of the last accounting period ending on or before march and the end of march . references in this part to an accounting period are in relation to a company within the charge to corporation tax, to an accounting period for the purposes of that tax, or finance bill part electricity generator levy in relation to a company not within the charge to corporation tax, to a period that would be an accounting period for the purposes of that tax were the company within the charge to that tax and had first come within it on january . see also section , which provides

benchmark amount for each subsequent financial year is the benchmark amount for the previous financial year increased or decreased by the same percentage as the consumer prices index for the december before the start of that subsequent financial year has increased or decreased from that index for the previous december, and rounded up to the nearest whole penny. before the commencement of each of the financial years ending in to , his majesty s revenue and customs must publish the benchmark amount for that financial year in such manner as they consider appropriate. subsections to apply where financial years fall within a qualifying period. generation attributed to a generating undertaking for that period is to be allocated, on a fair and reasonable basis, between those financial years. the calculation in step of section is to be applied separately to the generation allocated to each of those financial years by reference to the benchmark amount for that year. accordingly, the result of that step is to be the sum of those calculations. in this section consumer prices index means the all items consumer prices index published by the statistics board; financial year means a period of twelve months ending with st march. calculation of exceptional generation receipts attribution of generation the following amounts of generation, expressed in megawatt hours, are to be attributed to a generating undertaking for a qualifying period any grid connected electricity generation of a relevant generating station of the undertaking for the period, and finance bill part electricity generator levy the amount given by multiplying the amount of grid connected electricity generation for the period of a relevant generating station that is operated by a qualifying partnership in relation to the undertaking , by the qualifying proportion for that period . for the purposes of this part, a generating station is a generating station of a generating undertaking if in the case of an undertaking that is a company, it is operated by that company otherwise than in partnership with another person, and in the case of an undertaking that is a group, it is operated by any member of that group including where the station is operated in partnership and all of the partners are members of the group, but not including where the station is operated in partnership and one or more of the partners are not members of the group. grid connected electricity generation of a relevant generating station for a qualifying period means electricity generated by the station in that period for the purpose of giving a supply to any premises or enabling a supply to be so given where that supply would involve the use of a licensed distribution system or a licensed transmission system, and electricity that was, at any time, expected to be generated by the station in that period for that purpose. but for the purposes only of section , and step in section , ignore any electricity that was expected to be, but was not, generated by a relevant generating station unless the electricity was not generated in connection with an accepted bid to decrease generation under a settlement code. generation receipts where generation is attributed to a generating undertaking under section for a qualifying period, generation receipts in respect of that generation are to be attributed to that undertaking for that period. in this part generation receipts means amounts that it is fair and reasonable to attribute to generation attributed under section on the basis that the amounts reflect, directly or indirectly, the amount realised for the wholesale purchase of electricity arising from that generation . finance bill part electricity generator levy in determining the amounts realised for the wholesale purchase of electricity the following are, amongst other things, to be taken into account amounts received in accordance with a settlement code in connection with accepted offers to increase generation ; imbalance charges under such a code; payments and receipts under arrangements whose principal purpose is to act as a hedge of the exposure to changes in the price of electricity where those arrangements relate to generation attributed under section . the arrangements referred to in subsection may include arrangements comprising, or that include the use of, options, futures and contracts for difference . the treasury may by regulations make provision about when amounts can be fairly and reasonably attributed to generation under subsection . regulations may also provide that amounts of a specified description are always to be treated as generation receipts; amounts of a specified description are never to be treated as generation receipts. specified means specified in the regulations. subsection applies to generation attributed to a generating undertaking under section if provision, within the meaning of part of tiopa , has been made or imposed as between two persons by means of a transaction or series of transactions, that provision relates to that generation, if instead of that provision the arm s length provision had been made or imposed, one of those persons would have an amount that it is fair and reasonable to attribute the generating undertaking in accordance with subsection , and were that person within the charge to corporation tax, their profits and losses would be calculated as if the arm s length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed. where this subsection applies to generation attributed to a generating undertaking, generation receipts in respect of it are to be determined as if the arm s length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed. in this part the arm s length provision has the meaning it has in part of tiopa . finance bill part electricity generator levy allowable costs allowable costs means exceptional generation fuel costs of relevant generating stations , exceptional revenue sharing costs in respect of relevant generating stations , and qualifying electricity purchase costs . allowable costs may only be attributed to a generating undertaking for a qualifying period to the extent those costs are fairly and reasonably attributable to generation receipts attributed to the undertaking for the period, they reflect expenses of the undertaking , and those costs are not already reflected in the determination of the amounts of those receipts. allowable costs are only to be attributed to a generating undertaking if a claim is made for those allowable costs in a company tax return. in this part company tax return has the same meaning as in schedule to fa of that schedule . subsection applies to allowable costs of a person to be attributed to a generating undertaking if the costs arise as a result of provision made or imposed as between the cost holder and another person by means of a transaction or series of transactions, and were the cost holder within the charge to corporation tax, the cost holder s profits and losses would be calculated as if the arm s length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision actually made or imposed. where this subsection applies to allowable costs, the amount of those costs is to be determined as if that arm s length provision had been made or imposed instead of the provision it arose as a result of. in this section qualifying electricity purchase costs means costs reasonably incurred in the purchase of electricity in order to comply with the terms of an agreement under which it was expected that a relevant generating station will generate but does not do so. exceptional generation fuel costs for the purposes of a claim for allowable costs by a generating undertaking, the amount of exceptional generation fuel costs of a relevant generating station for a qualifying period is to be determined as follows step determine the generation fuel costs for the station for that period. finance bill part electricity generator levy step divide the amount of those costs by the amount of electricity generated by the station in that period that are attributable to a generating undertaking. step determine the baseline fuel cost of the station. step if the result of step is the same as or less than the baseline fuel cost, there are no exceptional generation fuel costs of the station for that period. step if the result of step is greater than the baseline fuel cost, subtract the baseline fuel cost from the result of step . step multiply the amount of electricity generated by the station that is attributable to a generating undertaking in that period by the result of step to give the amount of exceptional generation fuel costs of the station for that period. the generation fuel costs of a relevant generating station for a period means costs which, on a fair and reasonable basis, can be directly attributed to the acquisition of fuel used for generating electricity in that period that is attributable to a generating undertaking. the baseline fuel cost of a relevant generating station is the lesser of the average generation fuel costs of the station per megawatt hour for the reference period specified in the claim for allowable costs, determined on a fair and reasonable basis , and per megawatt hour. subject to subsection , the reference period that may be specified in the claim must be a period of at least months in which there is a period of months where the generating station was generating on or more of the days in that month period, commence no earlier than january , and end no later than march . where a reference period cannot be specified in the claim in accordance with subsection because there is no period of at least months between january and march in which there is a period of months where the generating station was generating on or more of the days in that month period a period of months commencing no earlier than january and ending no later than march may be specified as the reference period, finance bill part electricity generator levy the average generation fuel costs of the station for the purposes of subsection is to be determined as a fair and reasonable estimate of what those costs would have been had the generating station been generating in that period, and had it been generating on a similar basis in that period as it had been generating in the period of months ending with the end of the qualifying period to which the claim relates. where a generating station uses more than one type of fuel, a generating undertaking making a claim for allowable costs in respect of the exceptional fuel costs of that station may calculate the exceptional generation fuel costs in relation to each type of fuel separately, and may specify different reference periods for those calculations. where a generating undertaking makes a claim for allowable costs in respect of exceptional generation fuel costs of two or more generating stations that use the same type of fuel, the same reference period must be specified in relation to the calculation of exceptional generation costs in relation to fuel of the same type. exceptional revenue sharing costs subsection applies for the purposes of determining the amount of allowable costs that may be claimed by a generating undertaking in respect of exceptional revenue sharing costs. take the following steps to determine the amount that can be claimed for a qualifying period step determine if there are any relevant generating stations whose generation has been attributed to the undertaking in relation to which there are qualifying arrangements under which payments are made to a third party in relation to the undertaking by reference to the price received for generation by that station, or the wholesale price of electricity. step determine the amounts paid, in respect of each of those arrangements. step in relation to each such payment, determine the amount that would have been paid if the price received for generation by the station in question and the wholesale price of electricity had been the benchmark amount and subtract that amount from the amount actually paid. step add together the results of step . if the result of step is nil or less the generating undertaking, no amount can be claimed. finance bill part electricity generator levy if the result of step is more than nil, that amount can be claimed . for the purposes of subsection , arrangements are qualifying if they are arrangements under which fuel for generating electricity is acquired and the requirement to make payments under the arrangements relates to that acquisition. where the arrangements provide for some or all of the cost of paying the levy to be passed to the third party no amount of allowable costs in relation to the arrangements may be claimed unless subsection applies. subsection applies where the arrangements provide for a fixed proportion of the cost of paying the levy to be passed to the third party. where this subsection applies, the proportion of the amount calculated under subsection that is equal to the proportion of the costs of paying the levy that are not passed to the third party may be claimed. in this section third party , in relation to a generating undertaking, means a person that is not a significant equity holder in where the undertaking is not a group, the undertaking, or where the undertaking is a group, any member of the group; a person , other than a member of a group of companies, is a significant equity holder in a company if p is beneficially entitled to or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of c, p would be beneficially

of each of paragraphs to of subsection a company would be a member of more than one group, that company is to be treated as only being a subsidiary of the first company it is a subsidiary of applying the rules in those paragraphs in order . if at any time a company that is a generating undertaking becomes a member of a group that is a generating undertaking , the final qualifying period of the company ends at that time. if at any time a group ceases to be a group as a result of the principal member becoming a subsidiary of another group, the final qualifying period of the group ends at that time. lead member of a group and its qualifying periods for the purposes of section , the reference to an accounting period of a generating undertaking that is a group means an accounting period of its lead member. take the following steps in order to identify the lead member of the group step finance bill part electricity generator levy if there is a member of the group that is within the charge to corporation tax, and is nominated for the purposes of this section, that member is the lead member of the group. step if the principal member of the group is within the charge to corporation tax, it is the lead member of the group. step if there is a member of the group that is within the charge to corporation tax, and has no parent within the charge to corporation tax, and there is no other member of the group falling within paragraph , that member is the lead member of the group. step if there is more than one member falling within paragraph of step , the lead member is the member falling within that paragraph to which the greatest amount of generation would be attributed under section in the period of months ending with the later of december and the beginning of the first qualifying period in which the group is a qualifying generating undertaking if each such member were a generating undertaking, and that period of months were a qualifying period. step if none of the preceding steps identifies a lead member, the principal member of the group is the lead member of the group. for the purposes of subsection , a company is a parent of another company if that other company is a subsidiary of p, of a subsidiary of p, or of a subsidiary of a subsidiary of p, and so on. a nomination of a member of a group as the lead member of the group is to be made by the member of the group that, ignoring step in subsection , would be the lead member of the group , must be made by notice to hmrc, must specify when it takes effect, which must be no earlier than the commencement of the qualifying period in which it is made, and has effect until a further nomination takes effect, finance bill part electricity generator levy it is revoked, or the nominated member leaves the group. the revocation of a nomination of a member of a group as the lead member is to be made by the member of the group that, ignoring step in subsection , would be the lead member of the group, must be made by notice to hmrc, and must specify when it takes effect, which must be no earlier than the commencement of the qualifying period in which it is made. where a company becomes lead member of a group during a qualifying period, and that period is not the same as an accounting period of the new lead member the qualifying period ends, and a qualifying period commences that ends with the end of the current accounting period of the new lead member. liability of members of groups where a generating undertaking that is a group is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy the lead member is liable to pay that amount, and every other member is jointly and severally liable for that amount. election for members with significant minority shareholding to pay levy this section applies where a generating undertaking that is a group is liable to an amount of electricity generator levy for a qualifying period, a subsidiary member of that group has, at any time in that period, at least one significant minority shareholder, some, or all, of that amount is attributable, on a fair and reasonable basis, to the activities of the relevant member and, if it has one or more relevant subsidiaries, those relevant subsidiaries. where this section applies, the lead member of the group may elect that so much of the amount as is attributable to the activities of the relevant member and its relevant subsidiaries must be paid by that member. but the other members of the group are jointly and severally liable for that amount. an election under this section in respect of an amount of electricity generator levy for a qualifying period must be made no later than months after the end of that period. for the purposes of this part finance bill part electricity generator levy a person is a significant minority shareholder in a subsidiary member of a group if p is not a member of the group and p is beneficially entitled to or more of any profits available for distribution to equity holders of s, p would be beneficially entitled to or more of any assets of s available for distribution to its equity holders on a winding up, or at least of s s ordinary share capital is owned by p, and a group of companies is a significant minority shareholder in s if members of the group are, between them, beneficially entitled to or more of any profits available for distribution to

qualifying proportion for a qualifying period in relation to a generating undertaking that is a company and a qualifying partnership in relation to that undertaking is the proportion of the partnership s profits represented by the undertaking s share of those profits. for the purposes of that subsection, the qualifying proportion for a qualifying period in relation to a generating undertaking that is a group and a qualifying partnership in relation to that undertaking is the proportion of the partnership s profits represented by the sum of the shares of those profits of each partner that is a member of the undertaking. finance bill part electricity generator levy part of cta applies for the purposes of this section as it applies for the purposes of corporation tax. qualifying joint ventures for the purposes of this part a company is a qualifying joint venture if c is not a member of a group other than a group of which it is the principal member, and there are five or fewer persons who between them hold or more of c s ordinary share capital, or in a case where c does not have ordinary share capital, are beneficially entitled to or more of c s profits available for distribution to equity holders of c. in determining whether there are five or fewer such persons as are mentioned in subsection , the members of a group are treated as if they were a single company. a company that is not a member of a group is a participant in a qualifying joint venture if p holds or more of v s ordinary share capital, or in a case where v does not have ordinary share capital, p is beneficially entitled to or more of v s profits available for distribution to equity holders of v. a group of companies is a participant in a qualifying joint venture if a member

members between them are, beneficially entitled to or more of v s profits available for distribution to equity holders of v. where a participant in a qualifying joint venture is not a generating undertaking, the participant is to be treated as a generating undertaking for the purposes of this part. attribution and surrender of amounts joint ventures and significant minority shareholders non chargeable amounts of joint venture to be attributed to participants subsection applies where the result of step in section for a joint venture undertaking is greater than nil for a qualifying period. for the purposes of this part joint venture undertaking means a generating undertaking that is a qualifying joint venture, or that is a group whose principal member is a qualifying joint venture. finance bill part electricity generator levy the appropriate proportion of the non chargeable amount in relation to the joint venture undertaking is to be added to the result of step in section for each generating undertaking that is a participant in the qualifying joint venture that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking . where the qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking corresponds to a qualifying period of a participant of the jv, the whole of the appropriate proportion of the non chargeable amount is to be added to the result of step for the participant for that period. otherwise, the appropriate proportion is to be apportioned, on a fair and reasonable basis, between the qualifying periods of the participant in which the qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking falls. the non chargeable amount for a qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking is so much of the result of step in section for that period as is reduced as a result of step of that section. to determine the appropriate proportion of the participants in the jv for a qualifying period of the joint venture undertaking take the following steps step the generation receipts and allowable costs attributed to the joint venture undertaking for the period are to be allocated to the participants in the jv in proportion to the proportional interest each has in the jv at the time of the generation to which the receipts or costs relate. step in respect of each participant, subtract those allocated allowable costs from those allocated generation receipts. if the result of this step is less than nil for any of the participants, the appropriate proportion for that participant is nil. step the appropriate proportion for any other participant is the amount given by dividing the result of step in respect of that participant, by the result of step in section for the joint venture undertaking ignoring any amounts added to the result of that step in accordance with subsection , and where the result of step for one or more of the participants is less than nil, increased by the sum of those results . the proportional interest of a participant in the jv at any time is the percentage of the jv s ordinary share capital held where p is a generating undertaking which is a company, by p, or finance bill part electricity generator levy where p is a generating undertaking which is a group, by members of p, or in a case where the jv does not have ordinary share capital, the percentage of the jv s profits available for distribution to equity holders of the jv where p is a generating undertaking which is a company, to which p is beneficially entitled, or where p is a generating undertaking which is a group, to which members of p are beneficially entitled. where the appropriate proportion of the non chargeable amount is required to be added to the result of step in section for a generating undertaking that is not qualifying in the qualifying period in which it is to be added, that undertaking is to be treated as qualifying for that period. generation acquired and supplied by jv participants subsection applies to generation if the generation is attributed to a joint venture undertaking, other than in accordance with this section or sections to , it is supplied, directly or indirectly, to a generating undertaking that is a participant in the joint venture that comprises, or is the principal member of, the joint venture undertaking, and it is subsequently the subject of a wholesale purchase of electricity from q. where the generation attributed to the joint venture undertaking is generation falling within section , reference in subsection to supply or purchase is to any supply or purchase that was expected in consequence of that generation having occurred. where this subsection applies to generation the generation is to be attributed to q , in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to the joint venture undertaking under section in respect of that generation, do not take account of the transaction described in subsection , the generation attributed to q as a result of paragraph is to be attributed to q for the qualifying period of q in which the generation occurred, subject to paragraph , the generation attributed to q as a result of paragraph is to be treated for the purposes of this part as if it had been attributed under section , in determining the amount of generation receipts to be attributed to q under section in respect of generation attributed as a result of finance bill part electricity generator levy paragraph , take account of the costs of the transaction under which the generation so attributed was acquired or was expected to be acquired, and in determining the exceptional generation receipts of q for a qualifying period of q under section , any generation attributed to q for that period as a result of paragraph is to be ignored for the purposes of step . but the amount generation that is to be attributed to q in a qualifying period of q under this section is not to exceed the amount of generation attributed to the joint venture undertaking in respect of that same period multiplied by the relevant proportion. the relevant proportion for the purposes of subsection and section is the percentage of the jv s ordinary share capital held where q is a generating undertaking which is a company, by q, or where q is a generating undertaking which is a group, by members of q, or in a case where the jv does not have ordinary
