3894,"acts which regulate the company come into force when the company is registered under the companies act , and the repeal of the existing power under the act to make byelaws comes into force when new regulations come into force under clause . clause defines certain expressions used in the bill. part of the bill relates to the updating of the company s structure so that its management aligns with the companies act . clause enables the company to adopt the model articles for private companies limited by shares and thereby modernise the way in which the company is governed. the model articles are set out in schedule to the companies regulations . subsection makes it clear that the company does not need to change its name to register under the act. this clause is based on section of the faversham oyster fishery company act , which also authorised a historic statutory company to modernise its powers and regulation. clause provides that the registration of the company does not affect any rights or obligations of the company or render defective any legal proceedings by or against it, preserving the rights of third parties. clause provides for the update of outdated provisions of the act regulating the company. amendments to those provisions are set out in part of schedule . clause provides for provisions of the old acts regulating the company which are obsolete, or will become obsolete when the company is registered, to be repealed when the company is registered. in many cases the provisions of the old acts have been superseded by general legislation relating to companies or cemeteries. the repealed provisions are set out in part of schedule . part of the bill enables the transfer of the cemetery to a charitable body. this part is mainly based on the relevant provisions of the monken hadley common act , which provided for the transfer of the ownership of that common to a charity. clause defines the primary objects which the charitable transferee must have while the cemetery is in its ownership. the primary objects are first, the continued operation of the cemetery as a place for the burial and cremation of the dead, second, the repair and conservation of the monuments, buildings and historical landscape features of the cemetery for the benefit of the public, third, the conservation and management of historic records and other archives relating to the cemetery for the public benefit and fourth, the education of the public about the social, economic, architectural and cultural history of the cemetery and those buried in it. subsection provides that the objects of the charitable transferee must always include these primary objects. subsection provides that the charitable transferee and its successors can have other objects, but they must be charitable. this is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . clause provides for the transfer of the ownership of the cemetery from the company to the charitable transferee on a day to be appointed by the company. subsection requires the charitable transferee to remain a charity with the primary objects as part of its constitution for as long as it owns the cemetery. following the transfer, the company will have no interest in the cemetery and will be free of any liability for any obligations arising in relation to it before the appointed day. this is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . clause makes the charitable transferee responsible for the management of the cemetery. it is based on section of the highgate cemetery act . clause enables the charitable transferee to grant easements or other rights over the cemetery as it thinks fit. subsection makes the power to grant easements and rights subject to the normal rules that apply to the disposition of land by charities. this is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . clause enables the charitable transferee to grant and renew leases over any part of the cemetery subject to such conditions as they see fit. subsection provides that the protection of tenure under the landlord and tenant act and the housing act does not apply to leases created under this clause. this is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . clause enables further transfers of the ownership and management of the cemetery. the effect of subsections and is that, where a transfer is of the whole cemetery , the new transferee must be a charity and the provisions of the act and of the old acts that applied to the charitable transferee before the transfer are to apply to the new transferee after the transfer. subsection enables land that is not needed for the cemetery to be transferred without those requirements being met. under subsection the power to transfer surplus land requires a faculty from the church of england if it relates to consecrated land. this clause is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . clause enables the company to appoint a day for the transfer of the cemetery to the charitable transferee. the charitable transferee must have been registered as a charity before the transfer can happen. subsection requires the date of the appointed day to be publicised by a notice in the london gazette. this is substantially based on section of the monken hadley common act . part of the bill makes provision for the regulation and management of the cemetery. the functions in part are all conferred on the company as the current burial authority, but would be exercisable by the charitable transferee once the cemetery is vested in it. clause enables the company to make regulations to secure the good management of the cemetery. this power would replace the company s existing byelaw making power under the old acts. subsection makes general provision about the application of the regulations and enables regulations to provide that a person contravening the regulations is liable on summary conviction to a fine not exceeding level on the standard scale . clause is about the procedure for making those regulations. it replicates the byelaw making procedures in the local government act used by district councils. one of the effects of that is that the charity must apply to the secretary of state for confirmation of any regulations. clause makes it an offence to create a disturbance in the cemetery; cause a nuisance in the cemetery; willfully interfere with any burial taking place in the cemetery; wilfully interfere with any grave or vault, any tombstone or other memorial, or any flowers or plants on any such matter or play at any game or sport in the cemetery. this clause is based on article of the local authorities cemeteries order , which sets out the equivalent offences in respect of publicly run burial grounds. it replaces similar, but out of date, provisions in the act. clause provides the company with the power to extinguish rights of burial in grave spaces in the cemetery where a right of burial has not been exercised for years or more from the date of the latest burial in the grave space or, if there has been no burial in the grave space, from the date of the grant of the right of burial in the grave space. clause is substantially based on section of the city of london act , section of the greater london council act , section of the new southgate cemetery act and section of the bishop s stortford cemetery act which provide equivalent powers in respect of publicly run burial grounds in london, the new southgate cemetery and the bishop s stortford cemetery respectively. subsections and provide an objection period of at least months from the date on which the company gives notice that it intends to extinguish burial rights. the right of burial may not be extinguished if the registered owner objects to the notice of extinguishment and does not withdraw their objection. if any other person objects, the right may only be extinguished by consent of the secretary of state. the same applies to the removal of any memorial. subsection provides that extinguishment takes effect either on the date specified in the notice or, where an objection is made but withdrawn, the later of the date specified in the notice or the day after the notice is withdrawn, or, where an objection is made by a person other than the registered owner and the secretary of state consents to the extinguishment under subsection , on the day after the day on which consent is given by the secretary of state. subsections and provide a right to compensation for persons whose rights of burial are extinguished and for the amount of compensation to be determined by arbitration if it cannot be agreed. as an alternative to compensation, subsection allows the company to revive the burial right, in which case the burial right is deemed not to have been extinguished under subsection . this enables the company to deal with circumstances where the burial right owner does not respond to a notice of extinguishment within the specified period but makes a later compensation claim, and the company is content for the right of burial to endure. clause provides the company with the power to disturb, or to authorise the disturbance of, human remains that have been interred in the cemetery for years or more years, for the purpose of increasing the space for new interments. the power may only be exercised in respect of graves where there are no private burial rights, either because they have been extinguished under clause , because they have expired or because no right of burial was ever granted. any human remains disturbed must be reinterred in their original grave or in another grave in the cemetery. again clause is substantially based on the equivalent provision that applies in relation to publicly run burial grounds in london, as well as private burial grounds in new southgate and highgate. subsections to provide that if a proposal to disturb human remains is objected to by the registered owner of the extinguished burial right, the registered owner of a memorial, or a relative of the person to whose remains the proposal relates, the company may not exercise the powers under clause for a period of at least years. subsection enables the secretary of state to give the company directions about the way in which it removes or reinters human remains. this power does not apply in relation to consecrated land, which is covered by clause . subsection provides that section of the burial act , which makes it an offence to remove human remains other than in accordance with that section, does not apply to removals that are carried out in accordance with this clause. clause contains protection for graves and memorials that are the responsibility of the commonwealth war graves commission, graves in consecrated land, and certain graves designated as protected graves by the company. the powers in clauses and only apply to these graves with the agreement of the commission, in the case of a war grave, the diocese, in the case of consecrated land, or historic england and the local planning authority in the case of a protected grave. clause is based on section of the highgate cemetery act . subsections and allow the company to designate certain graves as protected graves, or to revoke such designations following consultation with or at the request of historic england and the relevant planning authority. subsections and require the company to maintain a public register of any protected grave designated under subsection . clause sets out the processes for giving notice in connection with the extinguishment of rights or the disturbance of remains. at least months notice must be given, the notices must be published in newspapers and on the company s website; must be displayed in the cemetery; and they must be sent to the registered owners of the burial rights or any
