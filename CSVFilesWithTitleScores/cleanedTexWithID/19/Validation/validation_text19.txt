given if the council intends to revoke a licence or temporary licence which is valid for a period of days or less. these requirements re enact, with minor modi cations, the provisions of subsection of section of the act. subsections to of clause introduce new powers which allow the council to suspend a licence immediately if there has been a breach of the licence s conditions because of dangerous, abusive or violent behaviour, and the council thinks immediate suspension is necessary for the protection of persons. if the council decides to suspend a licence immediately, it has days from the date

not take effect until the time for bringing an appeal to the magistrates court has expired, or where an appeal is brought, until the determination or abandonment of the appeal, provided that the

and the council believes that street trading in the licensable area should stop immediately if continuing it would present a safety hazard to users of the street, or in cases where the licence has been suspended because of violent, dangerous or abusive behavior. the clause also provides that where a street trading licence is revoked for non payment of fees and charges, the licence holder is only able to trade pending the decision of an appeal if all fees and charges due to the council have been paid and the licence holder continues to pay to the council the fees and charges due under the licence. clause re enacts with modi cations the provisions of section of the act. it would allow the holder of a street trading licence to specify the name and address of a relative or employee to

nominated relative or employee may apply to the council for that licence. unless certain grounds apply, the council must grant the licence to the nominated relative or employee. clause would provide a once only right to exercise succession rights. the opening words of subsection provide that the clause would only apply to street traders who have a licence at the time of the bill s enactment; their successors would not bene t from the provisions. the clause effectively contains a sunset provision for succession rights. city of westminster bill hl clause makes provision for temporary licences, re enacting with minor drafting amendments the provisions of section of the act. it provides that a temporary licence will be in a form similar to that of a street trading licence and it will contain such terms and conditions as the council may specify. it also provides that the council may establish a register of persons to whom it would be prepared to grant temporary licences. in addition to the

breach of the conditions of a street trading or temporary licence; when an authorised of cer considers that it is an urgent case and that for the good or safe management of the street it should be removed; and when it is placed on the street at the time of a special event or when works are being carried out to the street and an authorised of cer considers that for the good or safe management of

unlicensed street trading. it re enacts with modi cations, the provisions of subsections to of section of the act, which prohibits street trading by a person without a street trading or temporary licence. in addition to the provisions of the act, clause also makes it an offence for a person who is not a speci ed company to engage in street trading. it also prohibits street trading by a holder of a street trading or temporary licence on a day or place not speci ed in the licence without the council s permission or when the licence is suspended. the maximum penalty for an offence under clause is on summary conviction a ne not exceeding level on the standard scale. by virtue of amendments made by clause to schedule to the london local authorities act , the offences would be xed penalty offences for the purposes of part of that act. clause sets out other offences under the bill, re enacting and adding to section of the act. paragraph provides that contravening the conditions of a street trading or a temporary licence is an offence. paragraph provides for an offence of knowingly making a false statement in connection with an application for a street trading licence or

to warrant commencing proceedings came to the knowledge of the prosecutor. no proceedings can be brought more than years after the committal of a paragraph offence. city of westminster bill hl clause deals with seizure of items. subsection empowers an authorised of cer of the council or a constable to seize items, receptacles or equipment in cases where a person is reasonably suspected of committing a street trading offence. seizure under subsection is only permitted where the article may be required to be used in evidence in any proceedings in respect of the suspected offence or where it may be subject of forfeiture by the court under clause . subsection enables an authorised of ce or constable to seize an item for examination purposes where there is reasonable cause to suspect the item is prohibited by a specifying resolution and subsection enables seizure of receptacles or equipment which the authorised of cer or constable has reasonable cause to suspect is intended to be used in connection with an offence under the bill relating to the sale of refreshments. clause introduces a new procedure for dealing with receptacles used in unlawful street trading of refreshments, when they have been seized. currently, where the council seize items under section of the act, they must either return them to the person from whom they were seized, if certain circumstances arise, or they can be disposed of if there is a conviction and the court orders the items to be forfeited. the council can also apply to the magistrates court for a disposal order if the court is satis ed that the council have made reasonable efforts to ascertain the identity of the owner of the objects seized but failed. the council seize large numbers of hot dog and other food trolleys in the west end and because of the procedures that they have to go through, they have to store the trolleys for long periods at considerable expense. in nearly all cases, the trolleys are eventually disposed of by the council because either the person from whom the trolley was seized does not contest the criminal proceedings, or the council is unable to nd out who the owner of the trolley is. the effect of clause will be to enable the council to dispose of hot dog trolleys and other receptacles for the sale of refreshments without the need to go to court either to secure a prosecution or obtain a disposal order. safeguards are included in the clause to ensure that if the person from whom the receptacle is seized wishes there to be a court hearing, then he can secure it. this is achieved by including a requirement on the of cer who seizes the item to give the person from whom it was seized a notice. the notice can be completed by the recipient and returned to the council, and if it is done within the time stated on the notice and it contains all the necessary information and states that the recipient requires the council to seek a disposal order from the magistrates court, then the council would be under an obligation to seek such an order. at the magistrates court hearing, the recipient of the notice would have the opportunity to contest the proceedings. clause provides for the return or disposal of items seized under clause . items must be returned to the person from whom they were seized following the conclusion of proceedings in respect of a suspected offence, unless the court orders them to be forfeited under clause , or any award of costs to the council by the court has not been paid within days of the making of the order. seized items must be returned after days beginning with the date of seizure if no proceedings have been instituted; where proceedings have been instituted and then discontinued, seized items would have to be returned on the discontinuance of the proceedings. city of westminster bill hl seized items do not have to be returned where it is not possible to identify or ascertain the person from whom they were seized or that person s address. in such a case the council must apply to the magistrates court for an order as to the manner in which the items should be dealt with. clause makes provision about the disposal of relevant receptacles , namely hot dog trolleys and other receptacles for refreshments which have been seized under clause . it provides that if a notice given under clause is not completed and returned to the council in the correct manner and within the speci ed time, then the council will be able to dispose of the receptacle in question and recover its costs of doing so from the recipient, if it is able to identify and nd him. the powers of summary disposal would also be available to the council if when seizing the item they served a xed penalty notice on the person from whom the item was seized. if the xed penalty is paid within the required timescale, then the council would be able to dispose of the item. clause re enacts, with modi cations, the provisions of section to of the act. it permits a court before which a person is convicted of a street trading offence to order forfeiture of items. items may only be forfeited if shown to the satisfaction of the court to relate to a street trading
